Roving fittnes is an application that is meant to take the thinking and planning out of working out on the road.
So many times, I find myself wondering what I can do to get a good workout in,  while I'm away from home. No more worrying! Just pick your muscle group, use the built in stopwatch to record your time, and get to sweating!

This application uses the express-generator to build the scaffolding. I have used the Mongodb for the databases and passport for user authentification and security.

I still have a large ammount of information and other functionality I plan to add to this application, but for now, I feel like it demonstrates a significant ammount of different technologies.
